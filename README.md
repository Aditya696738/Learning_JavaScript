# Learning_JavaScript

Welcome to the **Learning_JavaScript** repository!  
In this repository, you will find every concept of JavaScript, from basic to advanced, demonstrated with practical examples and code snippets. This collection is designed to help you understand and master JavaScript through real coding exercises and explanations.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to learn JavaScript, whether you are a beginner or looking to strengthen your advanced concepts. It covers a wide range of topics, starting from basic syntax to advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming, asynchronous programming, and prototypal inheritance.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**
- **Control Flow:** if-else, switch, loops (for, while)
- **Arrays and Array Methods:** push, pop, splice, forEach, map, filter, etc.
- **Functions:** Declarations, expressions, arrow functions, higher-order functions
- **Scope and Closures**
- **Objects and Object Manipulation**
- **Classes and Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
  - Getters, Setters, and Static methods
- **Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance**
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await, Fetch API
- **Error Handling**
- **JSON and API Interaction**
- **Destructuring (Objects and Arrays)**
- **Practical Coding Problems and Solutions**

## Repository Structure

- `practice/` - Contains hands-on exercises and code snippets covering fundamental and advanced topics.
- `QUESTIONS/` - Includes JavaScript interview questions and their code solutions.
- `Script/` - Additional scripts demonstrating concepts and practical coding patterns.

## Sample Usage

You can run the JavaScript files in your browser's console or using Node.js to see the output and experiment with the code.  
For example:
```bash
node practice/script.js
```

## Example Topics Demonstrated

- Filtering and mapping arrays for data processing
- Creating and using classes and objects
- Fetching data from APIs and handling responses
- Implementing and using closures
- Grouping data and manipulating objects dynamically
- Using prototypes to extend built-in types
